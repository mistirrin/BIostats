#  now vector  fragments  contains fragments

#  we need two relationships between fragments:
#  (1) which fragment shares no prefix with suffix of another fragment
#      * This tells us which fragment comes first
#  (2) which fragment shares longest suffix with a prefix of another
#      * This tells us which fragment  follows  any fragment

#  First set array of prefixes to the default value   "noprefixfound".
#      Later, change this default value when a prefix is found.
#      The one fragment that retains the default value must be come first.

#  Then loop over pairs of fragments to determine maximal overlap.
#      This determines successor of each fragment
#      Note in passing that if a fragment has a successor then the
#          successor must have a prefix
