#extract species from psiblast output

# Method: 
#   For each line of input, check for a pattern of form [Drosophila melanogaster]
#   Use each pattern found as the index in an associative array
#   The value corresponding to this index is irrelevant
#   By using an associative array, subsequent instances of the same
#      species will overwrite the first instance, keeping only a unique set
#   After processing of input complete, sort results and print.

print(sort(result))                                     # sort the matches in alphabetical order and print
